Don't worry, in the vast majority of cases there's no risk, and infected patients will heal within a few days as in any flu. It is paramount for you to stay at home and take all precautions to avoid infecting others. We strongly recommend you to contact your doctor and tell him/her your symptoms. You should also be mindful about how you feel, in case your conditions worsen, you should contact emergency (by phone, don't go out) and follow their instructions.",
				"low": "Compliments, your symptoms show little compatibility with covid-19 symptoms. This is good news, but doesn't give 100% guarantee that you are disease free or can lower your guard. In many cases the virus presents itself without symptoms. So if you doubt of this result we encourage you to contact your doctor for further checks.",
				"mid": "Warning, your results are uncertain, so we encourage you check with your doctor for further tests on your health. You should not worry now. We recommend you to stay at home and take all the precautions to avoid getting the infection or (in case you have it) infect others, and phone your doctor for further checks. ",

				"high": "Warning, your result shows a high probability that, should you be infected, you would suffer severe complications. If you think you are infected you should contact your doctors explaining your conditions and following their instructions. If you are not infected you should take your precautions to the extreme, to avoid being infected.",
				"low": "Your physical and health conditions show that it's unlikely that when infected you develop serious symptoms from Covid-19. This is good news, but you should not lower your guard, there have been also some serious cases on otherwise healthy patients. It is therefore important to use all your precautions, also considering that you might become responsible of infecting others, who might be less fortunate than you are. ",
				"mid": "Warning, your test shows that you have a medium risk of developing serious conditions from the infection. You are not completely risk free from serious conditions and complications from the disease. You need to keep up your precautions though, there have been a few serious cases on otherwise healthy people. Furthermore each and every infected is contagious, so don't risk infecting others. ",

You should not worry though, in the vast majority of patients the infection is no different from a normal flu, and heals itself in a few days, while in just a low percentage of patients it will become something serious. Whether you are already infected or not, you immediately need to change your habits and rise your precautions, in order to protect yourself, or protect people around you from the infection. ",
				"low": "Compliments, your habits, lifestyle and neighbourhood exposes you to a low risk of infection, thus it's unlikely (but not impossible) that you have been already or will soon be infected. You should not lower your precautions though, the situation could change very quickly and without notice. In particular even though you might keep guard high, your neighbours might become infected, exposing yourself to higher risks. ",
				"mid": "Warning, your habits, lifestyle, and neighbourhood exposes you to a medium risk. Thus it is hard to say whether you have already been infected, but if you don't start immediately rising your precautions, it's possible that you might be infected soon. You should not worry now, in the vast majority of patients Covid-19 evolves like a normal flu, while only in a minority it worsen and becomes a dangerous disease. So it is important that you protect yourself so that you stay safe and infection free. In case you are already infected you should also take extra precautions, so that you don't infect others.",
