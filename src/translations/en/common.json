So we recommend that you **stay home** and avoid infecting other people. \n\nCovid-19 is so insidious, because in many people it manifests itself with light or even no symptoms, so the infected do not suspect that they are dangerous and continue their normal activities, helping to spread the epidemic.\n\nThere is no need to be afraid, the majority of the infected are not in serious danger and get away with a few days' rest, as in any flu. \nAt this stage, however, it is essential that you stay at home, limiting contact with other people so as not to infect them. We recommend that you **call your doctor**. \n\nAlso pay attention to your symptoms, if they get worse call your doctor (by phone, without leaving home) and follow his instructions.",
				"low": "Congratulations, your symptoms have a **low compatibility** with Covid-19, so you're probably not infected.\n\n**That's good news**, but it doesn't 100% guarantee that you're not infected or that you can let your guard down. There are also a lot of people infected, but with few or no symptoms at all. That's why we recommend you keep your guard up and your precautions high.\n\nIf you doubt this result we encourage you to contact your doctor for further examination.",
				"mid": "Warning, your symptoms correspond to an **uncertain situation**.\n\nSome of your symptoms correspond to those of Covid-19, but the data is not sufficient to make a prediction.\n\nThere is **nothing to worry**, but as we are not certain, we recommend you stay at home and take all precautions to avoid infecting other people. \n\nIf you think you are infected, we especially recommend that you stay at home and contact your doctor for further checks. We recommend that you do not go out to avoid getting the infection or infecting others.",
